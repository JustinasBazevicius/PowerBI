# Sales data analysis by Power BI 

In this project, I used Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes sales trends and customer behavior. By leveraging SQL queries to extract and aggregate relevant data from the AdventureWorks database, I focused on identifying key insights related to customer activity and sales performance.

The dashboard includes visualizations for monthly sales trends, revenue analysis by different time periods and sales types, as well as detailed breakdowns by customer categories and regions. I also incorporated cumulative sales data and year-over-year growth, highlighting revenue and profit comparisons, while ensuring that the dashboard was user-friendly and aligned with business objectives.
